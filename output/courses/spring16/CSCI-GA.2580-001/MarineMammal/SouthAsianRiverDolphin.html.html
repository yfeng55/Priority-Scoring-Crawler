found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and 
Pakistan which is 
split into two subspecies, the Ganges river dolphin (P. g. gangetica) and 
Indus river dolphin (P. g. minor). The Ganges river dolphin is 
primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries 
in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, while the Indus river dolphin is found in 
the Indus River in Pakistan and its Beas and Sutlej tributaries. From the 
1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 
1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to 
subspecies of a single species (see taxonomy below). The Ganges river 
dolphin has been recognized by the government of India as its National 
Aquatic Animal.
