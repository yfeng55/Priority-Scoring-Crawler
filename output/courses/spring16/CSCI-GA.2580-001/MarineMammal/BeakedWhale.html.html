<p>
Beaked whales are the members of the family Ziphiidae, which consists of 
22 species. These toothed 
<A href="Whale.html">whales</A> are notable for their elongated beaks. 
Among air-breathing animals, beaked whales are some of the most extreme 
divers: Cuvier's beaked whales regularly dive for an hour at a depth over 
1,000 m (3,300 ft),[1] and the longest and deepest foraging dive recorded 
is 137.5 minutes and 2,992 m (9,816 ft). This is the greatest dive-depth 
known for a mammal.
