<p>
A keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately 
large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. Such 
species are described as playing a critical role in maintaining 
the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other 
organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types and 
numbers of various other species in the community.
