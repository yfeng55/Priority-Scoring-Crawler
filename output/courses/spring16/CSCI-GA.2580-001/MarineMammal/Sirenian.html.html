<p>
Sirenia (commonly referred to as sea cows) are an order of fully aquatic, 
herbivorous 
<A href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammals</A> that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine 
wetlands, and coastal marine waters. Four species are living, in two 
families and genera. These are the 
<A href="Dugong.html">dugong</A> (one species) and 
<A href="Manatee.html">manatees</A> 
(three species). Sirenia also includes Steller's sea cow, extinct since 
the 18th century, and a number of taxa known only from fossils. The order 
evolved during the Eocene, more than 50 million years ago.

<p>
Sirenia, commonly sirenians, are also referred to by the common name 
sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. This comes 
from 
a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them 
for mermaids.

"Sea cow" (seekoei) is also the name for a 
<A href="Hippopotamus.html">hippopotamus</A> in Afrikaans. In 
some Germanic languages, the word Sea can mean either a body of fresh or 
salt water, so this follows from the species inhabiting lakes in southern 
Africa rather than the sea itself.
