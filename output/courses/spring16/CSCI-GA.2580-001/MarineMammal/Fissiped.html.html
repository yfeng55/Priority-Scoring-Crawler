(from Wikipedia)

<p>
Fissipedia is a former biological suborder comprising the largely 
land-based families of the order Carnivora. By and large, members of this 
suborder are meat-eaters, with the 
<A href="GiantPanda.html">giant panda</A> and 
<A href="RedPanda.html">red panda</A> (each 
exclusively herbivorous) being the most notable exceptions.

<p>
In some former taxonomic classifications, 
<A href="Pinniped.html">Pinnipedia</A> is treated as an 
order in its own right rather than as a suborder within the Carnivora. In 
these classifications, Fissipedia is the sole suborder of Carnivora, and 
is thus omitted on the grounds of redundancy.
