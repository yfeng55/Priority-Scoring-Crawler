(from Wikipedia)

<p> Iniidae is a family of river 
<A href="Dolphin.html">dolphins</A> containing one living and four 
extinct genera.

<p>
The dentition of Iniidae dolphins is heterodont, having conical, small 
teeth. The teeth extend lingually in the back and in the front they have a 
small depression on the side of each. These mammals are carnivorous, 
finding prey by using echolocation.

<p>
Breeding for Iniidae dolphins is seasonal, and varies according to food 
availability and water levels. A single offspring is produced per season. 
The gestation period is approximately 8.5 months, and they can produce 
offspring every year and a half. The lactation period is long, and calves 
stay with mothers for a few years before becoming dependent. The age of 
maturity is unknown, but thought to be at a few years old. Mating systems 
of this family are unknown, but scientists do know that females take after 
the young and look to be the limiting factor, which suggests a polygynous 
system.
