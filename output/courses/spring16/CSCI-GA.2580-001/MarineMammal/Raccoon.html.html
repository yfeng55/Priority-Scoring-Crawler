The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US Listeni/ræˈkuːn/, Procyon lotor), sometimes 
spelled racoon, also known as the common raccoon, North American 
raccoon, northern raccoon[6] and colloquially as coon, is a 
medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of 
the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in) 
and a body weight of 3.5 to 9 kg (8 to 20 lb). Its grayish coat mostly 
consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Two of 
the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front 
paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythology of several 
Native American ethnic groups. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, 
with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks 
for up to three years. The diet of the omnivorous raccoon, which is 
usually nocturnal, consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, 
and 27% vertebrates.
