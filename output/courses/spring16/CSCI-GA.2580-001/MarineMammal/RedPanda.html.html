<p>
The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called lesser panda, red bear-cat, 
and red cat-bear, is a small arboreal mammal native to the eastern 
Himalayas and southwestern China that has been classified as endangered by 
the IUCN[1] as its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature 
individuals. The population continues to decline and is threatened by 
habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, 
although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range 
countries.
