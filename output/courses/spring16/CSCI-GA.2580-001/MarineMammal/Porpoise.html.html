(from Wikipedia)

<p>
Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic 
<A href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammals,</A> that are sometimes 
referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family 
Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed 
<A href="Whale.html">whales</A>). There are eight extant 
species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely 
related to oceanic 
<A href="Dolphin.html">dolphins.</A> The most obvious visible difference 
between 
the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, 
spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, 
and other <A href="Cetacean.html">cetaceans,</A> 
belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed 
<A href="Ungulate.html">ungulates,</A> and their closest living relatives 
are the 
<A href="Hippopotamus.html">hippopotamuses,</A> 
having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.
