<p>
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, lit. "black and white cat-foot"; 
simplified Chinese: 大熊猫; traditional Chinese: 大熊貓; pinyin: dà xióng 
māo, lit. "big bear cat"), also known as panda bear or simply panda, is 
a 
<A href="Bear.html">bear</A> native to south central China. It is 
easily recognized by 
the 
large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and 
across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to 
distinguish it from the unrelated 
<A href="RedPanda.html">red panda.</A> Though it belongs to the 
order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant 
pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or 
even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may 
receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along 
with specially prepared food.
