(from Wikipedia)

<p>
The La Plata dolphin or Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is found in 
coastal 
<A href="Atlantic.html">Atlantic</A> waters of southeastern South America. 
It is a member of 
the river 
<A href="Dolphin.html">dolphin</A> group and the only one that actually 
lives in the ocean 
and saltwater estuaries, rather than inhabiting exclusively freshwater 
systems.
