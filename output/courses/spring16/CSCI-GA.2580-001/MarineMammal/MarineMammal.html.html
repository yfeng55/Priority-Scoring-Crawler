<A href="MarineOtter.html">marine otters, </A>
<A href="Walrus.html">walruses, </A> and
<A href="PolarBear.html">polar bears, </A>
form a diverse group of 129 species that rely on the ocean for their 
existence. They do not represent a distinct biological grouping, but 
rather are unified by their reliance on the aquatic environment for 
feeding. The level of dependence on the aquatic environment for 
existence varies considerably with species. For example, dolphins and 
whales are completely dependent on the marine environment for all stages 
of their life, whereas seals feed in the ocean, but breed on land.

<p>
Marine mammals can be subdivided into four recognized groups; 
<A href="Cetacean.html">cetaceans</A> 
(whales, dolphins, and porpoises) which includes the largest marine 
mammals, 
<A href="Pinniped.html">pinnipeds</A> (seals, sea lions and walruses), 
<A href="Sirenian.html">sirenians </A>(manatees 
and dugongs), and 
<A href="Fissiped.html">fissipeds, </A>which are the group of carnivores with 
separate digits (the polar bear, and two species of 
<A href="Otter.html">otters</A>).
