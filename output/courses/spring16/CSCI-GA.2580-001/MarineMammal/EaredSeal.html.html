<p>
An eared seal or otariid or otary is any member of the 
<A href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammal</A> 
family Otariidae, one of three groupings of 
<A href="Pinniped.html">pinnipeds.</A> They comprise 15 
extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 
1950s) and are commonly known either as 
<A href="SeaLion.html">sea lions</A> or fur seals, distinct 
from true 
<A href="Seal.html">seals (phocids)</A> and the 
<A href="Walrus.html">walrus (odobenids)</A>. Otariids are adapted 
to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but 
breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, 
and equatorial waters throughout the 
<A href="Pacific.html">Pacific</A> and Southern Oceans and the 
southern Indian and 
<A href="Atlantic.html">Atlantic Oceans</A>. 
They are conspicuously absent in the 
north Atlantic.
