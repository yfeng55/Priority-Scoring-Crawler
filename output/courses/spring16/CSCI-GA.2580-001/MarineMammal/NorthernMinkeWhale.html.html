The common minke whale or northern minke whale (Balaenoptera 
acutorostrata) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen 
<A href="Whale.html">whales.</A> It is the smallest member of the 
<A href="Rorqual.html">rorquals</A> and the second smallest 
species of baleen whale. Although first ignored by whalers due to its 
small size and low oil yield, it began to be exploited by various 
countries beginning in the early 20th century. As other species declined 
larger numbers of common minke whales were caught, largely for their meat. 
It is now one of the primary targets of the whaling industry. There is a 
dwarf form in the Southern Hemisphere.
