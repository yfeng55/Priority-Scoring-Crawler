Elephant seals are large, oceangoing 
<A href="Seal.html">earless seals</A> in the genus Mirounga. 
The two species, the northern elephant seal (M. angustirostris) and the 
southern elephant seal (M. leonina), were both hunted to the brink of 
extinction by the end of the 19th century, but numbers have since 
recovered.

The northern elephant seal, somewhat smaller than its southern relative, 
ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The most 
northerly breeding location on the Pacific Coast is at Race Rocks, at the 
southern tip of Vancouver Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The 
southern elephant seal is found in the Southern Hemisphere on islands such 
as South Georgia and Macquarie Island, and on the coasts of New Zealand, 
South Africa, and Argentina in the Peninsula Vald, which is the 
fourth-largest elephant seal colony in the world. Fossils of an as yet 
unnamed species of Mirounga have been found in South Africa, and dated to 
the Miocene epoch.[1]
