which contains six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea 
lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical 
waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, 
with the notable exception of the northern 
Atlantic Ocean. 
They have an 
average lifespan of 20.30 years. A male California sea lion weighs on 
average about 300 kg (660 lb) and is about 8 ft (2.4 m) long, while the 
female sea lion weighs 100 kg (220 lb) and is 6 ft (1.8 m) long. The 
largest sea lion is Steller's sea lion, which can weigh 1,000 kg (2,200 
lb) and grow to a length of 10 ft (3.0 m). Sea lions consume large 
quantities of food at a time and are known to eat about 5.8% of their body 
weight (about 15.35 lb (6.8.15.9 kg)) at a single feeding.
