(from Wikipedia)

<p>
Fur seals are any of nine species of 
<A href="Pinniped.html">pinnipeds</A> in the Otariidae family. 
One species, the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) inhabits the 
North Pacific, while seven species in the Arctocephalus genus are found 
primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. They are much more closely related 
to 
<A href="SeaLion.html">sea lions</A> than 
<A href="Seal.html">true seals,</A> and share with them external ears (pinnae), 
relatively long and muscular foreflippers, and the ability to walk on all 
fours. They are marked by their dense underfur, which made them a 
long-time object of commercial hunting.
