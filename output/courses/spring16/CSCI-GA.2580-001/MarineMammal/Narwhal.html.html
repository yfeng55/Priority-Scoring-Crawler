<p>
The narwhal, or narwhale (Monodon monoceros), is a medium-sized toothed 
<A href="Whale.html">whale</A> that possesses a large "tusk" from a protruding canine tooth. It 
lives year-round in the 
<A href="Arctic.html">Arctic waters</A> around Greenland, Canada, and 
Russia. It is one of two living species of whale in the 
<A href="Arctic.html">Monodontidae</A> 
family, along with the 
<A href="Arctic.html">beluga whale.</A> The narwhal males are distinguished 
by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left 
canine. The narwhal was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in 
his publication Systema Naturae in 1758.
