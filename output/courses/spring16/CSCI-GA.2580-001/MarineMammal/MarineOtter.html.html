The marine otter (Lontra felina) is a rare and poorly known South American 
mammal of the 
<A href="Weasel.html">weasel family</A> (Mustelidae). The scientific name means 
"otter 
cat", and in Spanish, the marine otter is also often referred to as gato 
marino: "marine cat". The marine otter spends much of its time out of the 
water and rarely ventures into freshwater or estuarine habitats, unlike 
the almost fully aquatic

<A href="Pacific.html">Pacific</A> and most other otter species.
