<p>
The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is a baleen 
<A href="Whale.html">whale</A> that 
migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a 
length of 14.9 meters (49 ft), a weight of 36 tonnes (40 short 
tons), and lives between 55 and 70 years. The common name of 
the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its 
dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of 
their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the 
sole living species in the genus Eschrichtius, which in turn is 
the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae. This mammal 
descended from filter-feeding whales that developed at the 
beginning of the Oligocene, over 30 million years ago.
