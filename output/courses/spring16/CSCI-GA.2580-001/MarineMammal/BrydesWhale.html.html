Bryde's <A href="Whale.html">whale</A> 
or Bryde's whale complex (/bruːdə/BREW-də) putatively 
comprises two species of 
<A href="Rorqual.html">rorqual</A> and maybe three. The "complex" means the 
number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive 
information and research. The common Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei, 
Olsen, 1913), a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and 
tropical waters, and the sittang or Eden's whale (B. edeni, Anderson, 
1879) a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific.[2] There 
is also a smaller, coastal form of B. brydei off southern Africa, and 
perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific that differs in skull morphology, 
tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde's whale. The recently 
described Omura's whale (B. omurai, Wada et al. 2003), was formerly 
considered a "pygmy" form of Bryde's, but is now recognized as a distinct 
species
