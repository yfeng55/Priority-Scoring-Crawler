The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen 
<A href="Whale.html">whale.</A> 
One of the larger 
<A href="Rorqual.html">rorqual</A> species, adults range in length from 12–16 m 
(39–52 ft) and weigh about 36,000 kg (79,000 lb). The humpback has a 
distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is 
known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it 
popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 
minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, 
though it may have a role in mating.
