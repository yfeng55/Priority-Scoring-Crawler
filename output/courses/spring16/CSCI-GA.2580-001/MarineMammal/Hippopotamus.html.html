The common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, is a large, 
mostly herbivorous mammal in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of only two 
extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy 
hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis). The 
name comes from the ancient Greek for "river horse" (ἱπποπόταμος). After 
the elephant and rhinoceros, the common hippopotamus is the third-largest 
type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl. Despite their 
physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed

etc.) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. The 
common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates 
around 60 million years ago. The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, 
belonging to the genus Kenyapotamus in Africa, date to around 16 million 
years ago.
