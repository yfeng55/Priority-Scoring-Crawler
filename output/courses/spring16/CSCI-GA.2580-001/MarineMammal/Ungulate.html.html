Ungulates (pronounced /ˈʌŋɡjᵿleɪts/) are any members of a diverse clade of 
primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses 
and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, 
camels, deer, and 
<A href="Hippopotamus.html">hippopotamuses</A>. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips 
of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while 
moving. The term means, roughly, "being hoofed" or "hoofed animal". As a 
descriptive term, "ungulate" normally excludes

morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries 
indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are 
typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), 
and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest 
cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of 
habitats, from jungles to plains to rivers.
