<p>
Right whales are three species of large baleen 
<A href="Whale.html">whales</A> of the genus 
Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the 
North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the southern right 
whale (E. australis). They are classified in the family Balaenidae 
with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with 
arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. 
The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough 
patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism 
by whale lice. Right whales can grow up to more than 18 m (59 ft) 
long with the maximum record of 19.8 m (65 ft)[8] and weigh up to 
100 short tons (91 t; 89 long tons), significantly larger than 
other coastal species such as

<A href="GrayWhale.html">grays,</A> or 
<A href="BrydesWhale.html">bryde's,</A> but 
smaller than

Right whales were named by whalers who 
identified them as the "right" whale to kill on a hunt due to the 
plentiful oil and baleen they could provide.[9]
