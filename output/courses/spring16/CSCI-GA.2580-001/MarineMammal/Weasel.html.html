A weasel /.wi.z.l/ is a mammal of the genus Mustela of the family 
Mustelidae. The genus Mustela includes the least weasels, polecats, 
stoats, ferrets, and minks. Members of this genus are small, active 
predators, with long and slender bodies and short legs. The family 
Mustelidae (which also includes badgers,

referred to as the "weasel family". In the UK, the term "weasel" usually 
refers to the smallest species Mustela nivalis.
